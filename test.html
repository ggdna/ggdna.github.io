  <h2><span style="font-style:normal">üíΩ üåø </span> welcome <span style="font-style:normal"> üåª üß¨</span></h2>
  <br>

  I'm a PhD student in the Molecular Systems lab at the Wyss Institute and Harvard Systems Biology.
  <br>
  <br>

  Conceptually, I'm interested in the relationship between biology and computation. How do biomolecular systems encode and process information? How can complex biological systems be represented and explored using silicon computers?
  <br>
  <br>

  More concretely, I've spent time thinking about chemical reaction network theory, DNA nanotechnology, single cell measurements, and high dimensional data.

  <h3>Interpretable representations, mutual information in high dimension, and  single cell data (coming soon!)</h3>

  <p>Neural networks are really good at learning low-dimensional representations of single cell data [Lopez et al., 2019]. But the resulting dimensions are abstruse and hard to interpret biologically. In this thread of work, we explore separable integration (SI), a representation learning approach that allows us to prescribe concrete biological annotations for learned latent dimensions. We find that SI naturally yields a framework for analyzing the statistical dependence of cellular pathways, through a quantity we name separably integrated mutual information (SIMI).

  <h3>de Bruijn graphs and DNA barcode design (in revision) [preprint][code][docs][interactive tool]</h3>

  <p>How many orthogonal DNA barcodes can you make with a certain barcode length? Trying to estimate this with pen and paper led me to a graph theoretic formulation of the barcode design problem, and a simple and massively scalable algorithm for orthogonal sequence design fell out of it. In this paper, we establish an equivalence between sequence symmetry minimization and finding Hamiltonian paths in de Bruijn graphs, and then leverage a century of progress in discrete math to make SeqWalk, a fast sequence design method. SeqWalk can generate maximally sized sequence libraries under a given sequence symmetry constraint basically instantaneously. The extra surprising bit is that the core sequence design algorithm is incredibly concise -- our relaxed implementation takes less than 100 lines of Python.</p>

  <h3>reversible computing with chemical reaction networks on a surface [pdf] [erik's commentary]</h3>

  <p>Biological systems compute very energy efficiently, when compared to today's silicon chips [Boahen, 2022]. In this work, we explored architectures for chemical computers that could be much more energy efficient than traditional silicon ones.
      We present designs for feedforward digital logic circuits that use only physically reversible rearrangement reactions on a surface.</p>
